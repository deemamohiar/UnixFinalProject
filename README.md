# UnixFinalProject
This is the repository for the Unix Final Project, which we called L&D Design. It contains the files that were created for our actual webpages (including the videos and photos necessary), as well as a .gitignore file, a LICENSE, an INSTALL file (which explains, step by step, how to achieve the end result that we have), and some other files that were created for testing and exploration purposes. 

### The three different folders that you can find represent the following:
* booksWebsite: This was the folder originally created that contained all the files for the books sub-page of our shared website.
* seriesFolder: This was the folder originally created that contained all the files for the series sub-page of our shared website.
* teamWebsite: This is the jekyll folder that actually builds our website.
